    <h1>How to use absolute path.</h1>
    <p>This is how to use absolute path. It look to the complete path from root directory (which is c:/ on windows) to the destination file.
        so to get to relative.html file, i used this url :  href="http://localhost:5500/howto_use_path/relative_path/relative.html" 
        The localhost is the root in which all the folders an folder are located. Localhost it self has its own path which eventually is on C-drive of 
        you computer.
    </p>
    <a href="http://localhost:5500/HTML_LinkPathAndImages/relative_path/relative.html">

        <h4>This link points to "relative.html" file which is in another folder called: "ralative_path".</h4>
