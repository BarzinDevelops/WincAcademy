    <h1>How to use Relative path.</h1>
    <p>This is how to use relative path. It looks at position of where you are to where you want to go. The ../ indicates that you first go UP, 
        to parent directory (in this case its: "howto_use_path") and from there you navigate into the folder 'ralative_path' 
        where the file 'relative.html' can be found.
