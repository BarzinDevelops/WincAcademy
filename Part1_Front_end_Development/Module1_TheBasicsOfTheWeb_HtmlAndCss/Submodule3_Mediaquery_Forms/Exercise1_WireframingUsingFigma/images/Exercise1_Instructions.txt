Exercise: Wireframing using Figma
Introduction
You're going to design a website using Figma. Figma is a very accessible wireframing tool that allows you to quickly create wireframes for your website. Think of it as Paint, but with a whole lot of extra features.

The goal of this exercise is to practice thinking conceptually about websites and their functionalities. Before you begin actually developing a website, it is always a good idea to ask yourself: what is my target audience? What should the result look like? You will notice that you'll end up asking these kinds of questions automatically when you start making wireframes.

Don't be put off by Figma's interface; it may seem intimidating, but wireframing tools such as Figma offer a lot of features. We will only be using the basic features.

Exercise
1. Open http://figma.com/ and log in or create an account.
2. Get familiar! Click around, try to figure out how Figma works. (For example, try to create some squares with text in them).
3. Think of a subject for your website
    - use a subject that you find interesting, fun, or important.
    - Think of what pages your website needs to have (keep it simple!)
    - Make sure your website includes form elements (like a search bar, contact form, or questionnaire).
4. Create a wireframe for the mobile version of your website
    - You may start by sketching it out using pen and paper!
        # Afterwards, go and design it in Figma.
    - Your designs don't have to be perfect. Keep them rough.
    - You're not going to be writing any HTML or CSS (yet).
5. Create wireframes for the desktop version of your website as well.
6. In a future exercise, you will convert your designs to an actual website using HTML and CSS.
7. Make your wireframes "public" in Figma using the "Share" button in the top-right.
    - Use the link currently in your browser's search bar.
    - Make sure to select "Anyone with the link" in Figma!
