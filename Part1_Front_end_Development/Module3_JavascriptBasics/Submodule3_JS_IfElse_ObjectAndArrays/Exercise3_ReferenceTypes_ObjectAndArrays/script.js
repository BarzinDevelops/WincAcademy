/* Part 1: Objects
1. Create an object called person.
2. person has the following key-value pairs / properties: name and age. Fill in you own name and age.
3. Use console.log(person) and run your JavaScript program, to log your object.
4. Only log the value of name using the key name.
5. Only log age age.
6. Use dot-notation and bracket-notation to log the two properties above.
7. Create a final key-value pair in which the key is evaluations and the value [7, 10, 9]. These are the marks you've received in the past year.
8. Log only the property evaluations. What is its value?
 */
console.log(`\n-------Part 1--------\n`);
let person = {
  name: "Barzin",
  age: 39,
  evaluations: [7, 10, 9],
};
console.log(person);
console.log(`Value of name (dot notation): ${person.name}`);
console.log(`Value of name (bracket notation): ${person["name"]}`);
console.log(`Age (dot notation): ${person.age}`);
console.log(`Age (bracket notation): ${person["age"]}`);
console.log(`Evaluations (dot notation): ${person.evaluations}`);
console.log(`Evaluations (bracket notation): ${person["evaluations"]}`);
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Part 2: Arrays
1. Create a new variable containing an empty array [].
2. Fill this array with at least three different colors in the form of strings. For example: "green", "blue", "red".
3. Log your new array to the console.
4. Log the length of your array to the console. Use array.length.
5. Log the first element of your array to the console. In our example, this would be "green".
6. Log the last element of your array to the console, in our example: "red". Assume the amount of elements in your array is unknown. array[3] will not give the correct result if later on five elements are contained within the array.
7. Add a 4th element to your array using the push method: array.push(). The result will be something like: ["green", "blue", "red", "Yellow"]
8. Now add a digit to your array using the push method. Result: ["green", "blue", "red", "Yellow", 5]
9. Finally add an object to your array, again with the push method. The object is as follows: {greeting: "hi, I am an object"}. Result: ["green", "blue",
"red", "Yellow", 5, {greeting: "hi, I am an object"}]
10. Log Only the greeting from the object (last element of your array), to the console. */

console.log(`\n-------Part 2--------\n`);

let colors = ["green", "blue", "red"];
console.log(colors);
console.log(`Length of array 'colors': ${colors.length}`);

console.log(`First element of array 'colors': ${colors[0]}`);
console.log(`Last element of array 'colors': ${colors[colors.length - 1]}`);

colors.push("Yellow");
console.log(`Elements in array 'colors': `, colors);

colors.push(5);
console.log(`Elements in array 'colors': `, colors);

colors.push({ greeting: "hi, I am an object" });
console.log(`Elements in array 'colors': `, colors);
console.log(
  `Greeting (=property of object) in array 'colors': ${
    colors[colors.length - 1].greeting
  } `
);

/* Part 3: A "real-life" object
Objects in JavaScript can be compared with objects in real life. Therefore we will continue with an exercise using a "real" object. We have created an array that contains three cat breeds. Below you will find this array with three cat breeds and their features.
