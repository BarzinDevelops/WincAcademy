Part 1: 50% discount
In addition to the previous 18+ age check, you want to implement a new age check. You would like to attract younger visitors to your pub, which is why you have decided that pub visitors between the ages of 18 and 25 should receive a 50% discount on their beers.

Write a new if-statement that checks if age is between 18 years or older and 25 years and younger.
console.log("You get 50% off!") if that's true, and something else if it's not.
Tip: use &&

Part 2: Fun action!
Your pub is 50 years old! That's why everyone called "Sarah" or "Abraham" gets a free beer! Okay, nobody is called Abraham these days, so let's make it "Bram".

Create a new const called firstName and give the person a name.
Check with an if statement whether the person is entitled to a free beer on this festive day.
console.log() the result of your if/else statement to the console.

Part 3: Anniversary discount
In addition to this playful promotion, there are many more festive discounts during your 50th anniversary.

Is the bill of your order more than 25 euros? Then you get free (veggie) bitterballen. Is your bill more than 50 euros? Then you get a free portion of nachos.

A bill of 100 euros or more? Then you get a free bottle of champagne.

You guessed it, write an if/else tree to let the visitors know which gift they will receive based on the amount of euros of his or her order.
Use the const named totalAmount .
